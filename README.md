## DAPS (Dense Auditory Prediction of Surroundings) benchmark

![dataset](./assets/daps_dataset.png)

We curated the DAPS benchmark based on [Matterport3D](https://niessner.github.io/Matterport/) and [SoundSpaces](https://soundspaces.org/). Tools and detailed instructions for preparing the data is available [here](https://github.com/HS-YN/DAPS/tree/main/DAPS).


## SAM (Spatial Alignment via Matching) distillation framework
